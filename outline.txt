Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana

Todos

- github project with setup script, config, etc.
- update profile photo on github

Takeaways

- problem being solved
-- extracting information from large volumes of log data

- logstash, elasticsearch, kibana
-- what each one is
-- how they work together
-- that they can be used independently (especially elasticsearch)

- enough knowledge to setup instance for reasonably configured logs files on own
-- prerequisites
--- jdk, disk space, access to install stuff, access to logs
--- os x, linux
--- curl, openssl
-- steps to follow
-- key configuration points to consider (stick to defaults, where possible)
--- open file limits on linux
-- where to go to find out more information
--- pointers to documentation

- enough knowledge to get useful information out of a running configuration
-- examples of using Kibana dashboards
-- examples of querying elasticsearch directly

- examples of what we learned using these tools
-- obfuscated data (functions, customers, IPs, URLs, etc.)

- things to look out for
-- open file limits
--- elasticsearch and logstash
-- securing elasticsearch
-- how logstash keeps track of indexed files
--- based on inode, not file name
-- Kibana 1.3.x supports facets, not aggregations
-- elasticsearch cluster monitoring/management tools
--- kopf
--- marvel
-- clustering is still maturing
--- haven't clustered personally
-- nodes auto-discover each other by broadcasting
--- set a cluster name
--- disable auto-discovery, if desired

- a pre-packaged configuration
-- pre-configured elasticsearch, logstash, kibana (extract and run)
-- example log data to index or tools to generate
-- pre-configured kibana dashboard(s)
